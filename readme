This is a prototype, i've created for HyperSenz, a startup company with mission to support people with disability by artificial intelligence solutions.
This prototype is built with Raspberry Pi, Python code and a 3d printer.
An OCR engine is able to extract text from an image and a TTS algorithm is able to reproduce the voice/text from a neck speacker.
With this prototype, blind people are able to read a book.
